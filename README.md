tic tac toe
=========

This is the stuff coding challenges are made of

#### What?
Javascript-based tic tac toe game. Stuck to the basics to demonstrate fundamental coding ability and UI design.

#### Process
Before googling anything (except for syntax lookups), I built the entire structure sans algorithm, as a testament to what I know off the bat.

#### Other Stuff
- Time to completion: X hours. _IN PROGRESS_
- Not tested in IE or other non-browsers. 
- Not meant to be gorgeous or pixel-perfect.
